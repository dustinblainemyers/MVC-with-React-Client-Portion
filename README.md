# Active Toggle

**Active Toggle** is a web application that allows for anonymous, simple feedback.

## Overview

Imagine for a moment you are in a classroom setting. The teacher is going over a powerpoint presentation. You are reading the slides and hearing what the teacher is saying, but you are not sure you exactly understand it. You would voice your concerns out loud but then again you did just get back from the restroom and you forgot to do the reading last night. The instructor is going pretty fast, is this just a quick gloss over of information you are already expected to know , or is everyone else in the same boat ?

### The Old Way

You raise your hand. "Urmm, I'm not sure if you mentioned this but", you say mutter out as you squirm in your seat. You had spent the last thirty minutes skimming over the required reading hoping to catch any clarification on the question you are about to ask. You probably missed a lot of the lecture while you were skimming the notes and are now even further behind. As you finish the question , another student pipes up "Yeah , I am not really getting that either. More students join in and it becomes evident that the instructor will have to start back at slide one .

### The New Way

#### Active Toggle To The Rescue

You open up **Active Toggle** and click on the "viewing" tab. You find the lesson you are currently in and you toggle your light to red. Nothing happens as a result of your individual light going into the red state, but more lights are silently and anonymously turning red in the classroom. After only two minutes of instruction, the instructors phone dings. Over 50% of the students have toggled their light red, so now hers is red as well. Apparently , I am moving too fast she announces to the class. Let's back up for a minute, it appears that I am leaving behind the majority of the class. The class ends on time and everyone leaves with a better understanding of the lecture topic " Electronic Payment Systems " .

#### A brighter future

Your name in this scenario ? Elon Musk . You leverage your knowledge of Electronic Payment Systems gained that day to establish a service now known as PayPal . You are now a billionaire and can now spend a significant amount of time saying ridiculous things on Twitter rather then worrying about bills. All made possible by **Active Toggle**
